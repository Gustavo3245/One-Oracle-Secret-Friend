🎁 Amigo Secreto Challenge
This project is a simple web application for organizing a "Secret Santa" or "Amigo Secreto" gift exchange. Users can add participants and then randomly draw a name to find out who their secret friend is.

🚀 Features
Add Participants: Easily add names to the list of participants.

Random Draw: A button to randomly select and display one of the names from the list.

Simple Interface: A clean and straightforward user interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

💻 Technologies Used
HTML: For the structure of the application.

CSS: For styling and a clean visual design.

JavaScript: To handle the core logic, including adding names, generating a random number, and displaying the results.

✨ How It Works
The application uses JavaScript to manage a list of names. When a name is added, it's stored in an array. Clicking the "Sortear amigo" (Draw a friend) button triggers a function that uses Math.random() to pick a random index from the array, and then displays the corresponding name.

This project was developed as a fun exercise to practice fundamental front-end development skills.
